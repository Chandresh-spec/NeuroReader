## 🚀 Overview

**NeuroRead** is an AI-powered inclusive digital reading platform designed to support neurodivergent learners and improve comprehension for all users. Unlike traditional PDF readers, NeuroRead uses **Agentic AI** to proactively assist users by simplifying complex text, adapting typography, and enhancing focus.

Built with accessibility-first principles, NeuroRead dynamically transforms the reading experience based on cognitive needs such as **Dyslexia, ADHD, and Visual Impairment**.
